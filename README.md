# Overview #

*Schooler* is an open-source software that simplifies data management for schools. Data includes information on students and their assessment grades. *Schooler* has graphing capability by which basic data analytics is possible. It is possible to export the grades as PDF reports. Software is implemented as a web application.![schoolerScreenshot.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/pMzyyE/images/1792185879-schoolerScreenshot.png)

# Installation #
## Ubuntu ##
* On Ubuntu, a web server is available by default at `/var/www`.
* [Download Schooler](https://bitbucket.org/arvindpdmn/schooler/downloads)  as a zip file and unpack the contents into `/var/www/html/schooler`. For the rest of this guide, files and folders are w.r.t. `/var/www/html/schooler`.
* Configure access to MySQL DB by editing these lines in file `configuration.php` (change `root` to username applicable to your MySQL server and supply the password):
```
	public $user = 'root';
	public $password = '';
```
* Import DB by running the following command (change `root` to username applicable to your MySQL server):
```
	mysql -u root < schooler.sql
```
* Grant write permissions to all users to specific folders as noted below:
```
	chmod -R a+w cache/ tmp/ logs/
	chmod -R a+w components/com_chronoforms5/chronoforms/uploads/studentForm/
```
* That's it! You may now access *Schooler* from any web browser by entering the URL `http://localhost/schooler`. To access the application by any other name of your choice, you may rename `schooler` sub-folder.

## Windows ##
* To run this software, a web server must be running. [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) is recommended as the web server. Install this first. For the rest of this guide, we assume that WampServer is installed at `c:\wamp`
* [Download Schooler](https://bitbucket.org/arvindpdmn/schooler/downloads)  as a zip file and unpack the contents into `c:\wamp\www\schooler`. For the rest of this guide, files and folders are w.r.t. `c:\wamp\www\schooler`.
* Edit the file `configuration.php` as follows (change `root` to username applicable to your MySQL server and supply the password):
```
	public $user = 'root';
	public $password = '';
	public $log_path = 'c:\\wamp\\www\\schooler\\logs';
	public $log_path = 'c:\\wamp\\www\\schooler\\tmp';
```
* Import DB from file `schooler.sql` into your MySQL.
* Edit the file `templates\yoo_master2\schooler.php` as follows:
```
	$basePath = "c:\\wamp\\www\\schooler";
```
* Grant write permissions to all users to specific folders noted below:
```
cache
tmp
logs
components\com_chronoforms5\chronoforms\uploads\studentForm
```
* That's it! You may now access *Schooler* from any web browser by entering the URL as `http://localhost/schooler`. To access the application by any other name of your choice, you may rename `schooler` sub-folder.

# Joomla! Admin Password #
* Administrator can access the Joomla! administrator interface at `http://localhost/schooler/administrator` with username `webadmin` and password `admin123`.

# Creating User Accounts #
* From Joomla! administrator interface, go to `[Users . User Manager . Add New User]`. Enter relevant details in tab `Account Details` (Figure 1). Choose a non-obvious password for each account to keep the system secure.![fig1.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/pMzyyE/images/3234526951-fig1.png)
* Go to tab `Assigned User Groups` (Figure 2). By default, `Registered` item will be checked. Do not change this. When creating accounts for teachers, also check particular classes to which the teacher are allowed to enter and modify data.![fig2.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/pMzyyE/images/3953217511-fig2.png)

# App Configuration #
* App can be configured by editing the file `templates/yoo_master2/schooler.config.php`.
* To change the header image appearing on every web page, you can replace the file `images/header.png` with any other image of your choice. The name of the image should be the same. For best results, it should be of dimensions 930 x 172 pixels.

# Data Backup #
* Backup procedure has been written in files `templates/yoo_master2/warp.php` and `templates/yoo_master2/schooler.php`. However, this backup functionality is not used since initial access can be very slow and frustrate the user. Backup code has been commented.
* On Ubuntu, a simple script can be written and installed as a cron job to take regular backups. This is left to the administrator.
* On Windows, it is recommended to take backup using a third-party free tool named [MySQLBackupFTP](http://mysqlbackupftp.com). FTP login and password can be configured in `c:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql{version-number}\.my.cnf` where {version-number} will correspond to your installation.
* No backup is taken of the code. Only data is backed up.

# Developer Notes #
* DB is named `schooler`.
* DB structure without application data is found at `schooler.sql`.
* Test data can be generated by running Python script `genTestData.py`. Generated file `testData.sql` can then be imported into the DB using phpMyAdmin. Do not do this on a live site since this will overwrite application data.
* Most of the customized code is in `templates/yoo_master2/schooler.php`.
* In Joomla! administrator interface, you may be prompted to upgrade Joomla! installation. Do not perform this upgrade since this will overwrite all code changes done on top of Joomla!.
* Currently, the system has defined two academic years: '2014-15', '2013-14'. In future, this will need to be updated. Please update `getYears()` function in `templates/yoo_master2/schooler.php`. Also update, form definition within Joomla! administrator interface by accessing the menu `[Components.ChronoForms5]` and updating `gradesForm`. In the  form, go to `Designer` tab and edit the `Year` field.
* To promote all students to the next higher class, access is restricted. Only the administrator can do this, since this is a critical update that will modify all student data.
* Sponsor data is disabled in all browser access. Students who have completed Class X are named as `Graduates`. However, graduates are not shown in browser views. Sponsors and graduates can be enabled, if required.

# Technologies #
* Joomla! is used as the content management system (CMS) for this web application. Version used is 3.2.3.
* Joomla! template used is Master2 from YOOThemes.
* Main data entered into the system fall into three types: student data, grades data, sponsor data. For each data entry, there is a corresponding input form. Free third-party component named Chronoforms, version 5, RC5, has been used for form creation, processing data and saving it to the database.
* Server-side programming is in PHP. Database used in MySQL. App has been tested on Apache server.
